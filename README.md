# Stardew Valley mods

## Rented Tools

The Harvest Moon style of tool upgrading mechanics is somehow frustrating, especially when you realized tomorrow is a sunny day right after leaving the watering can to Clint!

This mod allows you to rent the basic tool while yours is being upgraded.

## Self Service

Buy stuff while the shop is open, with or without someone at the counter.

Allows to shop at these shops when no one attends the counter:

- Pierre's
- Animal shop
- Carpenter's shop
- Fish shop

## Star du Vallet

What if Stardew Valley met French cinema stars ? That's the question talented french streamer [DollyWood_](https://www.twitch.tv/dollywood_) asked to her community during a charity event for student named [Stud'Live](https://studforce.fr/) in association with [Secours Populaire](https://www.secourspopulaire.fr/). For more information about the event please go the [dedicated page](https://www.secourspopulaire.fr/stud-live-une-operation-solidaire-en-ligne-au-profit-des-etudiants) on Secours Populaire web site.

This Stardew Valley mod is the answer.
